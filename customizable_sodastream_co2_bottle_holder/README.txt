Customizable Sodastream bottle holder for Cornelius kegs
========================================================

Summary
-------

This is a holder to hang a Sodastream bottle on a Cornelius keg. I've added
some customizer parameters if you want to change some of the features.

The holder has two collars to hold the bottle in place. There is a hook to
hang the holder on the grips of the keg, as well as two buckles for straps to
wrap around the keg. The holder is slightly curved on the back to match the
curvature of the Cornelius keg.

It's rather large, so unless you have a large printer it will have to be cut
after customization.

There are additional STL files included which are already cut with dovetails
added if you don't need to do any changes.

Print Settings
--------------

Printer: Anet A6
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 25

### Notes

I've printed mine in PETG as PLA might be too brittle for the hook and dovetails.

The full STL needs a lot of support. The split files (base, collar, hook) only
the collar needs support depending on rotation of the models.

Post-Printing
-------------

### Glue cut pieces

If you have printed the three cut pieces you will have to glue them together
to ensure they hold together.
