Customizable Shower Head Holder Mount
=====================================

Summary
-------

This is a customizable shower head holder mount replacement that fits the
mount on my shower. It's made to be mounted with an M6 bolt onto the mount on
the rail.

There are two mount options, spool and cylinder. They should be mounted with a
bolt going through it.

There are three sizes of the holder included, each with both mount options. If
you want to customize it further you can do it via the customizer.
